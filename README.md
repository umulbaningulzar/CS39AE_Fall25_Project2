This dataset includes medical information about real people, but it is anonymized and does not contain names or direct identifiers.  
The patterns shown in these charts are descriptive and should not be used to make decisions about any individual person.  
Because the data come from a specific group of patients, the results may not represent all populations or all experiences with diabetes.
